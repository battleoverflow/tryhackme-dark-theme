# TryHackMe Dark Theme

This is a dark theme created for TryHackMe, a Cybersecurity training platform that currently hosts over 400 rooms for various aspects of Cybersecurity.

I created this stylesheet because I do a lot of CTFs/rooms at night, and this makes it easier to traverse the website when in a dark environment. If TryHackMe ever releases a dark theme, then I will archive this repository, but for now, I wanted to create a temporary dark mode for myself and anyone else who may prefer it.

All pull requests are 100% welcome to improve the stylesheet since there are most likely some issues throughout the styling, but this should cover the majority of pages you'll visit.

## Instructions

To install the dark theme, you will need a browser extension. I personally use Stylebot since it's the easiest to use, in my opinion. You can download Stylebot here: https://stylebot.dev/ (It's available on Google Chrome, Firefox, and Edge).

Once Stylebot is successfully configured and set-up, open the extension, and on the left sidebar you should see "Sync", upload the provided JSON file there. You should now have a dark theme for TryHackMe!

Please feel free to add an issue if you find any weird color combinations, unreadable text, etc., but don't feel comfortable creating a pull request. I am happy to look into these as they're submitted!
