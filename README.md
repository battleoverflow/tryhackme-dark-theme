# TryHackMe Dark Theme

This is a dark theme created for TryHackMe, a Cybersecurity training platform that currently hosts over 500 rooms for various aspects of Cybersecurity.

I created this stylesheet because I do a lot of CTFs/rooms at night, and this makes it easier to traverse the website when in a dark environment. If TryHackMe ever releases a dark theme, then I will archive this repository, but for now, I wanted to create a temporary dark mode for myself and anyone else who may prefer it.

All pull requests are 100% welcome to improve the stylesheet since there are most likely some issues throughout the styling, but this should cover the majority of pages you'll visit.

## Instructions

To install the dark theme, you will need a browser extension. I use Stylebot since it's the easiest to configure; in my opinion. You can download Stylebot here: https://stylebot.dev/ (It's available on Google Chrome, Firefox, and Edge).

Once Stylebot is successfully configured and set up, open the extension, and on the left sidebar you should see "Sync", upload the provided JSON file there. You should now have a dark theme for TryHackMe!

Please feel free to add an issue if you find any weird color combinations, unreadable text, etc. I am happy to look into these as they're submitted!

Here are a few examples of the new theme:
